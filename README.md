# strawpoll-automated-voter
Mess with the democratic process by outvoting your friends in polls hosted by strawpoll.com

This program uses selenium to automate the opening of poll links and clicking on the second option. You can choose a different voting target by poll manually, acessing the html, and finding the xpath of the option you would like to vote for. Keep in mind that when in a medium size window, strawpoll often has ads overlaying the radiobuttons, and you may need to adjust the automated scrolling to click on the radiobuttons.

You will have to paste your strawpoll url into the code on line 24. It's labelled.

Unfortunately I could not find a way to make this work without opening a new tab every time the program goes to vote. You'll have to manually stop it before it eats up all your ram. Have fun!

:D
